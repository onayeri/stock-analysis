# stock-analysis
### Project Analysis
##### The  purpose of this project was to incorpoarte coding skills using Visual Basic Analysis (VBA) in relation to the VBA_challenge workbook within Excel. The VBA_challenge workbook consists of two dataset sheets that contain data on different stock types and there unique corresponding information. This information is seperated in two excel sheets; one contains the stock dataset for the year 2017 and the other sheet contains a stock dataset for the year 2018. Through VBA, a code is designed to create a new table that compiles and summarizes the data for each stock ticker by year. By doing this, we can obtain an output for the total daily volume and the return for each ticker, filtered by the year. This table is programmed to compare the percentage of return which will help the client make the best decision when deciding what stock is going to serve them the best.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

##### Advatages:
##### * Refactoring code is advantageous in general because it allows your code to be moldable and adaptable. Having a structured code that you can make small changes and additions to allows one to make there code run better or in a more convenient matter without having to start from scratch. This allows one to build upon their work rather than change all of the aspects. It's very likely that the new additions that you make would be pretty similar in the foundation of your original code, so it is also time efficient and an effective way to recycle code.

##### Disadvantages:
#### * Although there are many andvatages to refactoriing code, there are also downsides to doing this. I think that one of them is that you have to work within the constraints of your orginal code otherwise it could cause errors. Making more changes and additions to a code can also make it more error prone in general because you may be introducing lines of code that may not be compatible with the original outline.
