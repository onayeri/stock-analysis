# stock-analysis
### Project Analysis
##### The  purpose of this project was to incorpoarte coding skills using Visual Basic Analysis (VBA) in relation to the VBA_challenge workbook within Excel. The VBA_challenge workbook consists of two dataset sheets that contain data on different stock types and there unique corresponding information. This information is seperated in two excel sheets; one contains the stock dataset for the year 2017 and the other sheet contains a stock dataset for the year 2018. Through VBA, a code is designed to create a new table that compiles and summarizes the data for each stock ticker by year. By doing this, we can obtain an output for the total daily volume and the return for each ticker, filtered by the year. This table is programmed to compare the percentage of return which will help the client make the best decision when deciding what stock is going to serve them the best.

## Summary

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
##### Advatages:
* ##### Refactoring code is advantageous in general because it allows your code to be moldable and adaptable. Having a structured code that you can make small changes and additions to allows one to make there code run better or in a more convenient matter without having to start from scratch. This allows one to build upon their work rather than change all of the aspects. It's very likely that the new additions that you make would be pretty similar in the foundation of your original code, so it is also time efficient and an effective way to recycle code. It allows the abillity to solve more problems with a strategy already in place.

##### Disadvantages:
* ##### Although there are many andvatages to refactoriing code, there are also downsides to doing this. I think that one of them is that you have to work within the constraints of your orginal code otherwise it could cause errors. Making more changes and additions to a code can also make it more error prone in general because you may be introducing lines of code that may not be compatible with the original outline.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored VBA Script
##### Advantages:
* ##### Because a lot of the outline of the code and flow of inssructions was already completed in the original code, it made it easier for me to refactor the code with new information that I wanted to incorporate into the stock analysis table. I had more of an idea for where certain lines of code should go because a lot of the information repeated and carried the same nested for loop pattern that I could follow. Some of the VBA subscript outlines were multi-purposeful, so I was able to do two different things whil following the overall same script pattern.
---
##### Disadvantages: 
* ##### Similar to the disadvantages in coding in general, I faced errors when implementing some of my changes within the code. I had to be mindful of what lines of code I was adding and changing and how each of those changes effected the way the script ran. Keeping track of the changes as you go I think is good practice because it's easy to make a lot of changes and not know where the root of the error is within the code. VBA will only highlight where the issue is, but it will not give a lot of context on the root of the problem or solutions for it.
